              I am curious to know how various breeds develop sophisticated technology despite having what from our standard may be anatomical limitations. Obviously the Humanoid form has fingers and toes, but the insect races like the night crawlers (the Zigs) appear to have none. How do they evolve and construct developed ships and sophisticated technology allowing to travel to various locations in the universe and study other species?

            <p>You will realize that physical limitation does not matter after reaching certain levels of mental strength. Much can be handled by more advanced minds, moved, altered, programmed and produced at other levels of technological development. 
                The Zigs and other insectoids can do everything you do, much faster and more accurate than you might imagine.</p>
